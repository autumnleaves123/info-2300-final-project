# Project 4, Final Rubric

190 points

This rubric will grade your work from feedback milestones 2 and 3, and the final milestone. Milestones 1 and 4 have already been graded via a rubric and will not be graded again in the final milestone.

**Note**: **You will only get credit for the parts of your website which render in the browser.** Any portion of your website which is not accessible to the graders in the browser will not be graded for partial credit. For example, if a page does not load in the browser because there are PHP errors shown the PHP console, then you won't get any partial credit for this page because it is not accessible to the graders (i.e. it doesn't render in the browser). **Your code must work well enough that we can see the result in the browser before we will consider giving partial credit.**

Students can receive full, half, or no credit for each part of the assignment.

> [10/10] The navigation was good, but there was a lot of pages, and it was hard to follow (was it really necessary to implement this many pages?). The one thing I would critique is the page within a page (like meet the board within about) - this makes it confusing, it would have been better to just have all the content on the same page.
