  			<p>Join the Sign Choir every Wednesday from 5:30-6:30 in Goldwin Smith Hall 164! No prior knowledge of ASL is required!</p>
  			<p>Over the past several years, we have been holding weekly sign choir workshops during which we teach student-interpreted ASL translations of popular songs. We have also performed in various venues. Our current repertoire includes â€œIt's Time" by Imagine Dragons, "Fight Song" by Rachel Platten, "Love Yourself" by Justin Bieber, and "Sunday Mornings" by Maroon 5.</p>
  			<p>You can find upcoming Sign Choir rehearsals and performances on our <a class="link" href='events.php'>events</a> page.</p>
